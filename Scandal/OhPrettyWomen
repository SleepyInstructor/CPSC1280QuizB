Pretty woman, walkin' down the street
Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet
Pretty woman, I don't believe you, you're not the truth
No one could look as good as you

Mercy

Pretty woman, won't you pardon me?
Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see
Pretty woman, that you look lovely as can be
Are you lonely just like me?
Grow

Pretty woman, stop awhile
Pretty woman, talk awhile
Pretty woman, give your smile to me
Pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pretty woman, look my way
Pretty woman, say you'll stay with me
'Cause I need you, I'll treat you right
Come with me, baby, be mine tonight

Pretty woman, don't walk on by
Pretty woman, don't make me cry
Pretty woman, don't walk away, hey
Okay
If that's the way it must be, okay

I guess I'll go on home, it's late
There'll be tomorrow night, but wait
What do I see?

Is she walkin' back to me?
(Is she walkin' back to me?)
Yeah, she's walkin' back to me (yeah, she's walkin' back)
Whoa, oh, pretty woman
