No lying when it feels right
Stop trying, baby, listen
No hiding what it feels like
Don't play me like a rhythm

And I'm crying out for anything
And the thought of something else
Oh, I know you want to take my hand
So come over, come over and dance

So come over, come over, come over that
Come over, come over and dance
So come over, come over, come over that
Come over, come over and dance
