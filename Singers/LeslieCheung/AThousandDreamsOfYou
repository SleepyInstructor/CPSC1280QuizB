Oh It's time to dream
A thousand dreams of you
It's been so grand together yes together
You thrilled me from the start You brought the spring again
Your fingers touched the strings of my heart and made it sing again

I hope you dream a thousand dreams of me
All things we're planed doing together Wo..
And if you do I dream my whole life through
A thousand a million a zillion dreams of you all right

I hope you dream a thousand dreams of me
All things we're planed doing together
And if you do I dream my whole life through
A thousand a million a zillion dreams of you
